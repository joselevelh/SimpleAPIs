# Drakes Simple lookbook API
[Drakes](https://us.drakes.com/) is a menswear store and magazine focusing on high end tailored looks.
This project is an API for searching and accessing the images in the lookbook part of their editorial.
It supports simple search by title and search by common tags.
For example "Paris", "Summer", "2021" and similar search terms would lead to some matching lookbooks.
The lookbooks are served as a JSON containing all the links to the images on my own CDN.
